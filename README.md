# SortedMap in ZIG

## Description

Sorted Map is a fast key-value table, an advance version of [skiplist ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) as proposed by W.Pugh in 1989 for ordered mapping of keys to  values.

## Features 
* Takes any numeric key except the maximum possible value for the given type. 
* Takes any literal key of type `[]const u8` and of any length, but lexicographically smaller than `"Ã¿"` ASCII 255. 
* Values are arbitrary values.
* Works in `.set` or `.list` mode. The latter allows duplicate keys.
* Has forward and backward iteration.
* Has `min`, `max`, `median` key query.
* Supports queries by key or index, similar to Python's list class, including reverse indexing.
* Basic operations like `get`, `remove` work on a range as well.
* Updating the values by giving the `start_idx` - `stop_idx` range is O(1) each update. Yes, the whole map can be updated in O(n).
* Updating the values by giving the `start_key` - `stop_key` range is O(1) each update. *Coming soon*.

## Performance
The benchmark is a set of standard stress routines to measure the throughput for the given task. The machine is an Apple M1 with 32GB RAM, optimization flag `ReleaseFast`.

There are five tests in total, all of which are run on the random data with intermediate shuffling during the test stages:

**READ HEAVY**\
[read 98, insert 1,  remove 1,  update 0 ]\
Models caching of data in places such as web servers and disk page caches.

**EXCHANGE**\
[read 10, insert 40, remove 40, update 10]\
Replicates a scenario where the map is used to exchange data.

**EXCHANGE HEAVY**\
[read 1, insert 98, remove 98, update 1]\
This test is an inverse of *RH* test. Hard for any map.

**RAPID GROW**\
[read 5,  insert 80, remove 5,  update 10]\
A scenario where the map is used to collect large amounts of data in a short burst.

**CLONE**\
Clone the Map. That is, rebuild the map anew yet from the sorted data.

## How to run the benchmark
```
zig build bench
```
By default it runs 100_000 rounds each test on the `u64` type.

Give it a larger number to stress the map more.
```
zig build bench -- 1_000_000
```
Prepend with `-str` to test on the arbitrary `[8]u8` word.
```
zig build bench -- 1_000_000 -str
```

## How to use it
Copy `sorted_map.zig` and `cache.zig` into your project, or make a fork and work from there. Or you can import it as a dependency.

Declare in your file:
```zig
const SortedMap = @import("sorted_map.zig").SortedMap;
```

Initiate for numeric keys:
```zig
const map = SortedMap(u64, your_value_type, .list).init(your_allocator);
defer map.deinit();

```

Initiate for string literal keys:
```zig
const map = SortedMap([]const u8, your_value_type, .set).init(your_allocator);
defer map.deinit();
```
